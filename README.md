# ML Projects

This repository is a collection of my **demo machine learning projects**.  
It contains different folders where I practice and experiment with ML concepts such as prediction, classification, and unsupervised learning.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **prediction/** → Projects related to regression and prediction tasks.  
- **classification/** → Projects involving classification algorithms.  
- **unsupervised/** → Projects focusing on clustering and dimensionality reduction.  

## 🚀 Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Store and organize my ML practice work.  
- Keep track of my learning progress.  
- Share demo projects and experiments.  

## ⚠️ Note
These are **practice/demo projects** and may not represent production-ready code.  
Some large datasets are excluded to keep the repository clean.  
# Ml-projects-Demo-datasets
contains some basic ml models with basic scaling etc using sklearn datasets and some other demo datasets
